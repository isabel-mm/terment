Furthermore, corpus linguistics has played a crucial role in the advancement of natural language processing (NLP) technologies. By training computer algorithms on extensive corpora, researchers have been able to develop language models that possess the ability to understand and generate text that resembles human language. This has led to significant progress in areas such as machine translation, information retrieval, and other NLP applications.

To summarize, the text-corpus method is an immensely powerful tool in linguistic research that enables researchers to gain valuable insights into the rules and patterns of a language by analyzing a vast collection of texts. Its applications range from studying language variation and change to the development of NLP technologies. However, it is important to note that it is not directly related to the specific phrase "run into the sand." One notable milestone in the field of corpus linguistics was the publication of "Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English" in 1967 by Kučera and Francis. This work was based on an analysis of the Brown Corpus, which was a carefully selected compilation of approximately one million American English words from various sources. Kučera and Francis utilized computational analyses along with elements from linguistics, language teaching, psychology, statistics, and sociology to create a comprehensive and diverse body of work. Another significant publication was Quirk's "Towards a description of English Usage" in 1960, which introduced the Survey of English Usage.
